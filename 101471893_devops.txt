#Devops course 2156
The goal of George Brown College's COMP 3104 DevOps course is to instruct students on DevOps techniques, tools, and practices. 
It addresses Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Monitoring and Logging, Collaboration and Communication, and Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD). 
To enroll, students must have finished COMP 2154 (System Development Project). 
The course, which consists of lectures, practical laboratories, and project work, is normally provided during the fifth semester of the Computer Programming and Analysis curriculum. 
Students who successfully complete COMP 3104 are prepared for positions such as Site Reliability Engineer, Automation Architect, Release Manager, and DevOps Engineer.
