The Importance of DevOps in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that integrates software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enhance collaboration, efficiency, and automation throughout the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). It aims to reduce development cycles, improve deployment frequency, and ensure software reliability.

Why is DevOps Important in SDLC?
Faster Development & Deployment

DevOps automates software builds, testing, and deployments, reducing time-to-market.
CI/CD pipelines ensure continuous integration of code changes, leading to faster and more reliable software releases.
Improved Collaboration & Communication

Encourages seamless collaboration between developers, testers, and operations teams.
Reduces silos between departments, ensuring better alignment of goals and workflows.
Enhanced Software Quality & Stability

Automated testing helps detect and fix bugs early in the development cycle.
Continuous monitoring ensures issues are identified and resolved in real-time, improving system reliability.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Scalability
